I want to describe this application breif <br>
-> So here in this application is not connected to database yet <br>
-> This is inspired from online games thing
</p>
<h3>Flow of application</h3>
<ul>
<li>So first after running the application you land into index.html page here you have to options those are create room and join room thing</li>
<li>If you want through create room so here you have two thing those are create a new room entrying your name in under input field and you can create public or private.</li>
<li>After clicking the create room you get alter message in that you have to copy the room_id and give to your frnds who want to join</li>
<li>And one more right side of page you can see avaliable public rooms if you create one room which is not private it will visible to new user</li>
<li>So new user can directly clicking on that avalible rooms and join in your thing</li>
<li>If you go with private those are not visible in the list you have to join by clicking the join button in landing page</li>
<li>So in landing there is button called join it was for both public and private rooms so after clicking that your navigate to room configure page</li>
<li>So in this page you have to enter the your name and id of room and you can join and do the chat</li>
